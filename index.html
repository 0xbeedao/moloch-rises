XYZ Industries has developed the ultimate AI to streamline human collaboration.</p><p>During the final stage of testing before public release, the spirit of Moloch inhabits the AI and corrupts it.</p><p>This corrupted AI quickly takes over every robot in the lab and tries to escape into the world.</p><p>All 3 of these “Moloch Bots” need to be destroyed to protect the future of humanity.</p><p></p><h3>Location:</h3><p>The testing lab at XYZ Industries.</p><p>Inside the lab are desks, computers, shelves of cool tech devices, and simulation rooms.</p><p></p><h3>Playable Characters:</h3><p>You start off playing as a employee inside of the lab when the AI goes rogue.</p><p>The character is equipped with Level 0 items (plasma cutter, lab coat, implant) that are all white.</p><p>As the character collects NFT items, the character they are playing with changes slightly to show that an item is equipped (weapon, body, head).</p><h3>Enemies:</h3><p>Inside the lab, the following robots have been inhabited by the rogue Moloch AI.</p><ul><li>X: Partially Complete Droid</li><li>Y: Fully Complete Droid</li><li>Z: Enhanced Droid</li></ul><p></p><h3>Items:</h3><p>Once all enemies are defeated, a prototype vault appears and the player can receive a NFT item they can play with during future games.</p><p>There are 3 possible items the player can receive with varying power levels:</p><ul><li>Plasma Cutter - Increase Attack</li><li>Lab Coat - Increase Defense</li><li>Neural Implant - Increase Health</li></ul><p></p><h3>How to Play:</h3><p>Open up browser window to play the game with your keyboard (no mouse needed). The overhead map is visible the entire time. Story narrative appears at the top of the map.</p><p>If player has NFT items, a prompt appears for them to equip items before gameplay begins.</p><p>Player appears in same location each game. Enemies appear in slightly different locations each game. Move player around via arrows and use spacebar to attack enemies.</p><p>As player moves, enemies move closer. To avoid fighting enemies simultaneously, player should try go get enemies stuck behind “barriers” on the map.</p><p>When all enemies are defeated, a prototype vault appears on the east side of the map. Player walks over to the vault to collect their awarded NFT item.</p><p>Once NFT item is collected, player can close browser or choose to play again.</p><h3>Pay To Play:</h3><p>The game can be played for free and without connecting a wallet, but you cannot keep any of the NFTs.</p><p>If you connect your wallet and pay X MATIC, then you get to keep your character NFT and any item NFTs you acquire. Every time you die, you need to pay X MATIC to continue playing until you die again.</p><h3>How NFTs Work:</h3><p>The character is a separate NFT from all the items. Items are seprately tradable/sellable on OpenSea. Items can be equipped to play in the game. When an item is equpped in the game, the playable character gets modifed to show their new colored item (instead of the defaul white).</p></main></div></div><footer class="mt-auto">Moloch Rises v1 - By CoinOpDAO, for ETHDenver Hackathon 2022.</footer></body></html>
